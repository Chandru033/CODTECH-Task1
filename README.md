Overview of the project
Password Strength Assessment Tool (Python)

Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a tool that assesses the strength of passwords entered by users, providing instant feedback on password strength and guiding users to create more secure and unique passwords.

Key Activities:

Length Analysis: Assess the length of the password to ensure it meets the minimum recommended length.
Complexity Analysis: Evaluate the password's complexity by checking for the presence of:
Uppercase letters
Lowercase letters
Numbers
Special characters
Uniqueness Analysis: Check the password against a database of commonly used passwords to ensure it is unique.
Feedback Mechanism: Provide users with instant feedback on password strength, suggesting improvements when necessary.
Algorithm Development: Develop and integrate algorithms for length, complexity, and uniqueness analysis.
Technologies Used:

Python:
Python 3.x (for implementing the password analysis algorithms and storing the database of commonly used passwords)
Libraries:
zxcvbn (for estimating password strength)
bcrypt (for secure password hashing)
